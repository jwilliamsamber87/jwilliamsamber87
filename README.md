🌸✨ Hey there! I’m Jessica Williams ✨🌸
⚡ Electrician Apprentice | Data Analyst | Future Applications Engineer
📍 Reno, NV | 👩🏽‍💻 Studying Electrical Engineering & Full-Stack Development

💡 I bridge the gap between electrical systems and data science — transforming complex shop-floor data into smart, connected applications. With over eight years in production and manufacturing, I developed a deep understanding of how machines, data, and people work together. That hands-on experience is what sparked my passion for automation, electrical systems, and intelligent web-based tools that make operations run smoother and smarter.

🚀 My mission: To design responsive, data-driven systems that connect the power on the floor with insights on the screen — where data meets design and innovation powers productivity.

🛠️ Skills & Focus Areas:
⚡ Electrical Systems | 🐍 Python | 💻 SQL | 🌐 JavaScript | ⚙️ PLC Integration
📊 Tableau | 📈 Power BI | 🔗 Data Automation | 💡 Process Optimization

🌈 Tech lover. Builder. Problem-solver. Coffee-powered creative 💖
🧠 Always learning. Always building.
📬 Open to collaborations, internships, and innovation opportunities!

✨ “Grounded in power, wired for data.” ⚡💅🏽
